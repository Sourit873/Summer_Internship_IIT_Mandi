# Summer_Internship_IIT_Mandi
I, Mr. Sourit Saha, student of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kanpur, have successfully completed my summer internship during the period from 08.05.2022 to 15.07.2022. My project is titled “Numerical Modelling of Soft Particle Collision employing DEM”. My project work involved understanding the mathematical framework behind hard and soft particle impact model for addressing elastic collision of two particles and further, numerical modelling of soft particle collision employing discrete element method (DEM). The DEM simulations have been carried out in YADE, an open-source Linux based software. Hertz-Mindlin type contact force-displacement model has been adopted for this purpose. Benchmark tests for two particle impact have been conducted, and the post collision kinematics and kinetics of the particles have been compared against the existing literature.
